The Image Relay API
===================

The [Image Relay](https://imagerelay.com) API allows IR users to access many Image Relay features through a JSON RESTful web interface. Not all plans have access to the API, please see https://www.imagerelay.com/pricing for details and contact sales@imagerelay.com if you'd like to learn more about adding API access to your plan.

Making a Request
----------------

All requests start with https://[company url].imagerelay.com/api/v2/

In curl a request would look like this:

```shell
curl -u user:pass -H 'User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)' https://api.imagerelay.com/api/v2/folders.json
```
If you are sending data to the API, include the Content-Type header and the data as JSON.

```shell
curl -u username:password \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)' \
  -d '{ "name": "New Catalog" }' \
  https://api.imagerelay.com/api/v2/folders/555/children.json
```
Authentication
--------------

To test things out and get started, you can use __HTTP Basic authentication__ with the IR API. In production, though, you should use an __API Key__ for authentication. That way you don't have to worry about storing Image Relay usernames and passwords in your own application.

[Read our Authentication docs](https://github.com/imagerelay/API/blob/master/sections/authentication.md) for more detailed information regarding API Key and Basic authentication.


Identify your app
-----------------

You must include a `User-Agent` header with the name of your application and a link to it or your email address so
we can get in touch in case you're doing something wrong or something great. Here's an example:

    User-Agent: MyCompany (http://www.mycompany.com)

If you don't supply this header, you will get a `403 Forbidden`.

Rate limiting
-------------

You can perform up to 5 request/second from the same IP address. If you exceed this limit, you'll get a [429 Too Many Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-new-status-02#section-4) response for subsequent requests. API usage is limited to Professional and Enterprise plans, and up to 250,000 requests per month. For increased usage please contact sales@imagerelay.com.

Errors
------
The actions you can access in the API are dependant upon the permission levels assigned to your Image Relay account.
For instance, not all users are permitted to upload files or create folders, or see a list of users. If you find yourself
receiving "401 Unauthorized" errors, please confirm your permission level with your Image Relay Administrator.

If you find a typo or an error in the documentation, we welcome pull requests. You can also [submit an issue](https://github.com/imagerelay/API/issues) (will require a github account) and we will look into it.

If you have questions or trouble implementing the API, you can reach out to support@imagerelay.com and we'll help you out.
