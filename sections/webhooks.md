Webhooks
=========

Webhooks allow you to receive notifications at an end-point of your choice for a myriad of events in Image Relay.
Get notified when a file is uploaded, a new user is added, a folder is deleted, etc.

When there is a problem with a webhook, Image Relay will send an email to the user that created the webhook.
The API also supports optionally adding additional `notification_emails` to the webhook if you wish to
alert other email addresses if issues arise.

Get Webhooks
-----------

* `GET /webhooks.json` returns a list of all of your webhooks
* `GET /webhooks/<webhook_id>.json` returns details about the specified webhook.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "<webhook_id1>",
    "user_id":"<user_id>",
    "resource": "file",
    "action": "processed",
    "url": "<url_to_post_to>",
    "created_at": "2021-06-01T13:45:36.000Z",
    "state": "normal",
    "notification_emails": null
  },
  {
    "id": "<webhook_id2>",
    "user_id":"<user_id>",
    "resource":"file",
    "action":"expiration_date_set",
    "url":"<url_to_post_to>",
    "created_at":"2015-06-18T19:18:35Z",
    "state": "paused",
    "notification_emails": null
  }
]
```

Create Webhook
--------------

* `POST /webhooks.json` will create a new webhook.

After you create a webhook, when the event occurs that is specified in the webhook, Image Relay will POST
the event details back to you at the `url` specified in the webhook. Valid `state` values are:
* `normal`: normal functionality.
* `paused`: user-initiated paused state, webhook will not be invoked
* `error`: Image Relay encountered too many HTTP errors when invoking the webhook callback URL, callbacks have been temporarily suspended until the next day when it will be auto-resumed. If youâ€™d like to resume your webhook sooner, [Update Webook](#Update-Webhook) and change its state.


```json
{
  "resource": "file",
  "action": "created",
  "url": "<url_to_post_to>",
  "notification_emails": [
    "email1@example.com",
    "email2@example.com"
  ]
}
```

This will return `201 Created`, if successful.

Update Webhook
--------------


* `PUT /webhooks/<webhook_id>.json` will update a webhook's `state`.

```json
{
	"state":"paused"
}
```

Will return `200 OK` and a representation of the specified webhook.

```json
{
  "resource": "file",
  "action": "created",
  "url": "<url_to_post_to>",
  "state": "paused",
  "notification_emails": null
}
```

Delete Webhook
--------------

* `DELETE /webhooks/<webhook_id>.json` will delete the specified webhook.

This will return `204 No Content` if successful.

Supported Webhooks
------------------

* `GET /webhooks/supported.json` returns a list of webhooks that Image Relay currently supports, these include the resource
and action required to create the hook. Authentication is not required for this call. Check it out here: [https://api.imagerelay.com/api/v2/webhooks/supported.json](https://api.imagerelay.com/api/v2/webhooks/supported.json)

This will return `200 Ok`

```json

  {
    "resource":"file",
    "supported_actions":
    [
        "created",
        "expiration_date_set",
        "expiration_date_removed",
        "file_type_changed",

### Response

All Webhook POSTs will contain the following information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "event": {
            "resource":"file",
            "action":"added_to_folder",
            "resource_id":"<resource_id>",
            "actor_id":"<user_id>",
            "recipient_id":"<recipient_id>"
    },
    "data": { "id":"<file_id>" }
}
```

In the `event` section, `resource` is the type of resource triggering the event (e.g. file, folder...), `action` is the
type of action that occurred (e.g. created, updated...), `resource_id` is the unique id in Image Relay for the resource
that triggered this event. `actor_id` is the unique id of the user who caused the event to happen (i.e. uploaded the file,
created the folder), and `recipient_id` is optionally present when necessary. For instance, in the case of a "File added to
Folder" triggered, `recipient_id` would be the unique `folder_id` of the folder to which the file was added.

The `data` section contains data specific to the resource being triggered. For a File, for instance it will contain details
about the file, for a user, it will contain details about the user and so forth. The `event` section will always be present
for all webhook calls.
