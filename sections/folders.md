Folders
=======

Folders are one of the main ways to keep files organized and findable in Image Relay.

Get Folders
-----------

* `GET /folders.json` will return all top-level folders viewable by the user
* `GET /folders/555/children` will return all the child folders of the specified parent folder.

```json
[
  {
    "asset_count":1,
    "child_count":0,
    "created_on":"2012-06-19T08:41:19Z",
    "id":11136,"metagroup_id":null,
    "name":"McCadam Logos",
    "parent_id":6527,"
    updated_on":"2012-07-23T15:39:16Z",
    "user_id":405
  },
  {
    "asset_count":47,
    "child_count":1,"
    created_on":"2012-10-09T12:09:25Z",
    "id":11150,
    "metagroup_id":null,
    "name":"Product Photography",
    "parent_id":6527,
    "updated_on":"2012-10-09T12:09:25Z",
    "user_id":405
  }
]
```

Get Root Folder

* `GET /folders/root.json` will return the root of all the folders for this user. This folder isn't visible in the UI, calling children on this folder is the equivalent of
calling `GET /folders.json`

```json
{
  "created_on":"2008-06-23T20:29:10Z",
  "id":6527,
  "metagroup_id":null,
  "name":"0",
  "parent_id":null,
  "updated_on":"2012-04-11T15:23:32Z",
  "user_id":0
}
```

Get a folder's children, paginated, 100 per page
 
 * `GET /folders/555/children?page=1` will return a paginated set of children folders along with pagination information. 
 
 **Please note the unpaginated version of this endpoint will be deprecated in the near future so please use this version if building a new integration**

```json
{
    "folders": [
      {
        "asset_count":1,
        "child_count":0,
        "created_on":"2012-06-19T08:41:19Z",
        "id":11136,"metagroup_id":null,
        "name":"McCadam Logos",
        "parent_id":6527,"
        updated_on":"2012-07-23T15:39:16Z",
        "user_id":405
      },
      {
        "asset_count":47,
        "child_count":1,"
        created_on":"2012-10-09T12:09:25Z",
        "id":11150,
        "metagroup_id":null,
        "name":"Product Photography",
        "parent_id":6527,
        "updated_on":"2012-10-09T12:09:25Z",
        "user_id":405
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "current": 1,
        "previous": null,
        "next": 2,
        "per_page": 100,
        "pages": 2,
        "count": 155,
        "prev_page_path": null,
        "next_page_path": "/api/v2/folders/555/children?page=2"
    }
}
```

  "created_on":"2012-06-19T08:41:19Z",
